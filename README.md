Assignment 1:- DevOps Assignment – Automate EC2 Deployment

This project demonstrates how to automate the provisioning of an EC2 instance on AWS using Terraform.

🚀 Steps to Deploy
1. Configure AWS CLI

Run the following command and provide your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, Region, and Output format:

aws configure

2. Create an SSH Key

Generate an SSH key locally:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/mykey


Import the public key into AWS:

aws ec2 import-key-pair \
  --key-name "mykey" \
  --public-key-material fileb://~/.ssh/mykey.pub

3. Set Environment Variable for Key Name

Avoid hardcoding the key in Terraform. Instead, export it as an environment variable:

export TF_VAR_key_name="mykey"

4. Deploy Infrastructure with Terraform

Go to the Terraform directory and run:

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

5. Get Public IP of EC2

After deployment, fetch the public IP:

terraform output ec2_public_ip

6. Test in Browser

Open your browser and visit:

http://<PUBLIC_IP>

7. Destroy Resources After Testing

To avoid unnecessary costs, destroy the infrastructure when no longer needed:

terraform destroy -auto-approve


📌 Assignment 2 – S3 Integration, IAM, and Logging

This assignment extends the EC2 deployment by integrating S3 for log archival and IAM roles for secure, keyless access.


🔑 Features Implemented
1. Secure S3 Bucket

A private S3 bucket was created to store application logs.

The bucket name is configurable via a Terraform variable to avoid conflicts.

2. IAM Roles for Security (Principle of Least Privilege)

Two IAM roles were created:

Uploader Role (Role B): Can only create bucket objects and upload logs, with no read/download permissions. Attached to the EC2 instance.

Read-Only Role (Role A): Can only list files in the bucket, used for verification.

3. Keyless EC2 to S3 Access

The EC2 instance uses an IAM Instance Profile to assume the Uploader Role.

This allows the instance to interact with S3 without storing AWS keys locally.

4. Automated Log Upload

The user_data.sh script was updated to:

Start the Java application.

Upload logs automatically to s3://<bucket-name>/app/logs.

5. Log Retention Policy

An S3 Lifecycle Rule automatically deletes logs after 7 days.

This helps optimize costs and prevents clutter.

6. Code Organization

Terraform configuration is modularized:

main.tf – EC2 and networking

iam.tf – IAM roles and policies

s3.tf – S3 bucket and lifecycle rules




Verification using the Read-Only Role
The final step of the assignment was to ensure the security policies were working correctly by using the specially created read-only 'Auditor' role.


This was tested using the "Switch Role" functionality within the AWS Management Console. By providing the AWS Account ID and the specific name of the auditor IAM role (e.g., Dev-s3-auditor-role), I temporarily adopted its limited permissions to interact with the S3 service.


✅ How to Verify
Since the bucket is private, you won’t see logs by default. Instead, follow these steps:

Use Role A (Read-Only Role):
Assume the role or log in with it to test.

Access Bucket via Direct URL:
Open the following in your browser:

https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/<your-unique-bucket-name>


Replace <your-unique-bucket-name> with the actual bucket name (e.g., private-key1q2w3e).

Check Logs:
You should see uploaded logs inside the app/logs folder.

🗑️ Cleanup

Once done, destroy the infrastructure to avoid charges:

terraform destroy -auto-approve
